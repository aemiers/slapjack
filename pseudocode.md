* Make game fully playable without the DOM (manually invoking instances of Game, Players, and running methods, etc, from your console) to force yourself to think data-model-first

shuffle deck now works!

deal cards -
  select shuffled deck
  split deck in half
  i 0-24 of array push to player1 hand array
  i 25-51 of array push to player2 hand array
  slice

  var player1Cards =

addToCenterPile
  take first index from player's hand array
  shift
  add to centerPile array at the end?? or beginning??
  add player's color to the center pile

Slap -
  jack, doubles, sandwiches- all cards in centerPile are suffled and  added to that player's hand
  center pile is an empty array again
  deal goes to next player
  or if ()
  or if ()
  the last 5 of the png === last 5 of the other

  Make sure it goes to the person who slapped, not whose turn it is
    -create event listeners for keys

  slap when not a jack, that player forfits the top card in their hand (0 index) and it gets added to bottom of opponent's hand

  when a player is all out of cards, the other player deals until a jack is displayed. If the person out of cards slaps, that person gets the center pile of cards and game goes on.

  after a player slaps, whose turn is it? other person's

If a player slaps when neither a Jack, Double, or Sandwich is on top of the central pile, the player who slapped loses the card on top of their hand and it is added to the bottom of their opponentâ€™s hand.


How do I know which player is slapping? the specific key that's pressed. If f is pressed, it was p1, if j is pressed, it was p2. 


Change everything over to find the card object
Check that it still works in the console.


* Create 3 decks on the DOM

* Connect Game data model to the DOM

* Display the Player win data on the DOM
  player's win also increases by 1

* Automatically reset the game to allow for a new game to be played after the previous game is won

* Persist Player win data using local storage (number of wins should persist across page refreshes)
